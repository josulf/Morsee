Morsee Twitter Client
=====================
Morsee is a very simple Twitter client which can only send tweets.

It runs on a **Texas Instruments Stellaris EKK-LM3S8962 Evaluation Kit**, which has a *ARM Cortex-M3* MCU, with some push buttons, a buzzer, ethernet and a little OLED display.

This project was developed at [Euskal Encounter 20](http://www.euskal.org) for the competition **Make your gadget** in less than 36 hours, son don't expect a clean code, it just works. It uses a library from [Mondragon Unibertsitatea](http://www.mondragon.edu), and all the code is under BSD license.

The account where we tested it, with some demonstration tweets is [MorseeBot](http://www.twitter.com/MorseeBot).
