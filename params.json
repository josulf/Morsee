{"body":"Morsee Twitter Client\r\n=====================\r\nMorsee is a very simple Twitter client which can only send tweets, using [SuperTweet](http://supertweet.net) to authenticate with the service.\r\n\r\nIt runs on a **Texas Instruments Stellaris EKK-LM3S8962 Evaluation Kit**, which has a *ARM Cortex-M3* MCU, with some push buttons, a buzzer, ethernet and a tiny OLED display.\r\n\r\nThis project was developed at [Euskal Encounter 20](http://www.euskal.org) for the competition **Tu Gadget** (*Your Gadget*) in less than 36 hours, son don't expect a clean code, it just works.\r\n\r\nAll the code is released under the **BSD** license, unless it is said otherwise at the source file. It uses the following external pieces of code:\r\n* The BSP (*Board Support Package*) provided by Texas Instruments with the evaluation kit.\r\n* A library to use the peripherals from [Mondragon Unibertsitatea](http://www.mondragon.edu).\r\n* [FreeRTOS](http://freertos.org) real time operating system.\r\n* [uIP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/uip-stack/) TCP/IP network stack.\r\n\r\nThe account where we tested it, with some demonstration tweets is [MorseeBot](http://www.twitter.com/MorseeBot).\r\n","tagline":"Morsee Twitter Client","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
